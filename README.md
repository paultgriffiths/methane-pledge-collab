## 
code for generating emissions files masked by country

Steps for running

1. set up conda/venv with geopandas0.8, xarray installed (cartopy if you want plots)

    1.1 I will try to set up a reproducible method to set these up in due course - asap really

2. change various hardcoded data paths on JASMIN to user directories
